    <h1>Natural Resources</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What are Natural Resources?</h2>
        <p>Natural resources are materials or substances that occur in nature and can be used for economic gain. They are essential for human survival and play a crucial role in various industries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Types of Natural Resources</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Renewable Resources:</strong> These can be replenished naturally over a relatively short period. Examples include solar energy, wind energy, water, forests, and biomass.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-renewable Resources:</strong> These exist in limited quantities and cannot be replenished at a rate comparable to their consumption. Examples include fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), minerals, and metals.</li>
            <li><strong>Biotic Resources:</strong> Derived from living organisms, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Abiotic Resources:</strong> Derived from non-living components of the environment, such as air, water, sunlight, and minerals.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Importance of Natural Resources</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide essential raw materials for various industries.</li>
            <li>Support human life through food, water, and energy.</li>
            <li>Contribute to economic growth and development.</li>
